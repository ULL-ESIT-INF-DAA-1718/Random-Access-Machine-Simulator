# Random Access Machine Simulator.

##1. Information

If you want to see further information about the project, just check the folder `asset-files/gui√≥n.pdf`
There it's explained all the information.

Random Access Machine is a theoretical computing machine, with almost the same power of expresivity as the Turing Machine.
We are developing a simulation.

##1. Installing and running

To install the simulator, you have to execute the following commands.

```shell

$ git clone https://github.com/ULL-ESIT-INF-DAA-1718/ull-esit-inf-daa-1718-pract1-alu0100945850.git
$ cd ull-esit-inf-daa-1718-pract1-alu0100945850
$ make

```

After executing `make` the project is going to be compiled in the file `ram-simulator`
To execute the program you must:
```shell
ram-simulator program-file in-tape-file out-tape-file debug

```

debug is an optional parameter.
